# About ProjectSOTS

ProjectSOTS is a research team that gathered by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mehmet Fatih Amasyali under TUBITAK Project (Sort Optimization of Training Samples in Machine Learning, Project Number: 120E100 ).

Human learning is incremental (not all examples is given at once) and starts with simple examples. Our education systems are based on this hypothesis. It starts with basic concepts, then it goes into difficult ones. In the field of machine learning, this hypothesis was used to develop curriculum learning (CL) and its derivatives.

Our aims: Finding more generalizable Curriculum Learning methods, providing theoretical explanations for CL methods, examining the effect of using augmented data within these methods.
